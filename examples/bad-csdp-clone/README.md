# `bad-csdp-clone`

As the title suggests, this is a clone of the classical interior-point solver CSDP (see [gh:coin-or/Csdp](https://github.com/coin-or/Csdp)).
The goal was to re-implement it in a much more readable way and drop most of the lower-level performance tweaks.

The implemented algorithm is outlined in [1] and is a modified version of the algorithm presented in [2] - a primal-dual interior point method specific to SDPs.
Main additions of the implementation over the basic idea are:

- exploitation of sparsity and block-structured matrices,
- heuristic initialization attempting to start with the right scale, and
- [Mehrotra-type predictorâ€“corrector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehrotra_predictor%E2%80%93corrector_method) steps to speed up convergence.

## Progress

As of right now, this is just a very rough (but working) implementation.
Next steps:

- extend the `VecSymDomain` class by smarter Jordan multiplication, and block-structured matrices
- go through the main solver file of CSDP and implement all the rules for detecting infeasibility etc.
- add a nice CLI to make it available to other examples
- add an integration test on [SDPLIB](https://github.com/vsdp/SDPLIB) to check correctness and compare with performance of CSDP
